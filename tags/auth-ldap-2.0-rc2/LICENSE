The vast majority of this implementation is subject to the standard
3-clause BSD license. Copyright is held by Three Rings Design and
Landon Fuller, and the license and official copyright can be found at
the bottom of this file.

Small portions of the implementation were taken from various sources, including:
	- FreeBSD libc (strlcpy)
	- FreeBSD kernel (pf ioctl validation)
	- kazlib (hash table implementation)

Associated copyrights and licenses are documented below. You'll find that they
are all compatible and as permissive as the standard BSD license -- in fact,
most are simply small variations on the license.

In addition, some public domain sources are included with this distribution and
used as a part of the build process:
	- The lemon parser generator (http://www.hwaci.com/sw/lemon/)
	- Makeheaders (http://www.hwaci.com/sw/mkhdr/)
